# Creating & Sending Newsletters

The **Newsletters** collection is where you design your content and initiate the delivery process.

## Designing Content

Every newsletter is built using a powerful block editor, allowing you to create rich, visually appealing layouts.

### Key Content Fields:
- **Title**: The subject line of your email.
- **Hero Image**: A featured image that appears at the top of the email.
- **Content**: A flexible rich-text editor where you can add text, headings, banners, and more.
- **Upload PDF**: Optionally attach or link to a predesigned PDF.

## The "Send" Process

Once your newsletter is ready and **Published**, you can send it to your audience.

### How to Send:
1. Open the newsletter you want to send.
2. Ensure its status is set to **Published**.
3. Click the **Send Newsletter** button at the top of the page.
4. Select your target:
    - **Subscriber Group**: Send to everyone in a specific segment.
    - **Specific Subscribers**: Choose individual people from your list.
5. Click **Confirm Send**.

## Intelligent Delivery Features

- **Active Only**: The system automatically filters your list and will **only** attempt to send to subscribers marked as **Active**.
- **Duplicate Protection**: The system checks the delivery logs before sending. If a subscriber has already successfully received this specific newsletter, they will be skipped to avoid spamming.
- **Background Processing**: When you click send, the emails are added to a "Job Queue". This means you don't have to wait for thousands of emails to send—the system handles them in the background.
