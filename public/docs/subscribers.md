# Managing Subscribers & Groups

This section covers how to manage your audience and segment them for effective communication.

## Subscribers

The **Subscribers** collection stores everyone who has signed up for your newsletter.

### Key Fields:
- **Name**: The subscriber's name (optional).
- **Email**: The unique identifier for the subscriber.
- **Active**: A toggle that determines if the subscriber will receive emails.
    - **Note**: New sign-ups from the website are **Inactive** by default. This allows you to verify or vet subscribers before sending content.
- **Groups**: Relationships to one or more Subscriber Groups.

### How to Activate a Subscriber:
1. Navigate to **Newsletter Management > Subscribers**.
2. Click on the subscriber you wish to activate.
3. Locate the **Active** toggle in the sidebar.
4. Toggle it to the "on" position and click **Save**.

## Subscriber Groups

**Subscriber Groups** allow you to segment your audience based on their interests or behavior.

### Creating a Group:
1. Navigate to **Newsletter Management > Subscriber Groups**.
2. Click **Create New**.
3. Give your group a unique name (e.g., "Monthly Members").
4. Click **Save**.

### Assigning Subscribers to Groups:
You can assign groups directly within an individual Subscriber's record. Depending on your global settings, a subscriber can belong to a single group or multiple groups.

## Pro Tip: Pruning Subscribers
If you ever change your system settings from "Multiple Groups" to "Single Group" mode, you can use the **Prune Subscribers** button in the **Settings** global to automatically clean up your audience and keep only their first assigned group.
